How To Use These Files

xah-fly-keys.pdf is just a pdf file.
But, xah-fly-keys.md is an anki file.
Just downloand anki from its website.
Install it, create a deck. Say: "xah-fly-keys"
and import the md file into it.
Anki will ask which type of delimiter the file
uses. Just write "\t" without quotes, meaning 
TAB.
Then, you can play and learn the keybinding in
a funny way...
