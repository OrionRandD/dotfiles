Create a Dired buffer that is the union of some existing Dired buffers.
With a non-negative prefix arg, you are prompted for `ls' switches.
With a non-positive prefix arg, you are prompted for file and dir
names to add to the listing - see below.

You are prompted for the name of the Dired union buffer.  Completion
against names of existing Dired buffers is available, but you can
enter any other name to create a new Dired buffer of that name.

If the union buffer name you choose names an existing Dired buffer,
then what happens depends on whether that buffer is an ordinary Dired
directory listing or a list of arbitrary file names.  That is, it
depends on whether `dired-directory' is a directory name or a cons of
a Dired buffer name plus file names.

* If the buffer is an ordinary Dired listing, then it is converted to
  an explicit list of absolute file names, just as if these had been
  chosen individually.  The existing buffer and window are replaced by
  new ones that show the explicit listing.  (This replacement is
  necessary because the list of files contained in an ordinary Dired
  listing cannot be modified.)

* If the buffer lists arbitrary file names explicitly, then it is
  updated to include also the files from any Dired buffers and any
  additional files that you specify.

If the union buffer name you choose does not name an existing Dired
buffer, then its `default-directory' is the same as the
`default-directory' before invoking the command.

If you use a non-positive prefix arg, then you can next choose
additional file and directory names to add to the listing.  Use `C-g'
when done choosing them.

Any directory names you choose this way are included as single entries
in the listing - the directory contents are not included (these
directories are not unioned).  To instead include the contents of a
directory chosen this way, use a glob pattern: `/*' after the
directory name.

You are then prompted for the Dired buffers to union.  Use `C-g' when
done choosing them.  These Dired listings to union are included in the
order that you chose them, and each entry is listed only once in the
new Dired buffer.

The new Dired listing respects the markings, subdirectory insertions,
and hidden subdirectories of the selected Dired listings.  However, in
case of conflict between marked or unmarked status for the same entry,
the entry is marked.  Similarly, in case of conflict over an included
subdirectory between it being hidden or shown, it is hidden, but its
contained files are also listed.

See also command `diredp-add-to-dired-buffer'.

From Lisp:
 DIRED-NAME is the name of the resulting Dired union buffer.

(autoload 'dired-mark-files-regexp "dired+/dired+" "\
Mark all file names matching REGEXP for use in later commands.
`.' and `..' are never marked or unmarked by this command.

Whether to mark or unmark, and what form of file name to match, are
governed by the prefix argument.  For this, a plain (`C-u') or a
double-plain (`C-u C-u') prefix arg is considered only as such - it is
not considered numerically.

Whether to mark or unmark:

 - No prefix arg, a positive arg, or a negative arg means mark.

 - Plain (`C-u'), double-plain (`C-u C-u'), or zero (e.g. `M-0' means
   unmark.

The form of a file name used for matching:

 - No prefix arg (to mark) or a plain prefix arg (`C-u', to unmark)
   means use the relative file name (no directory part).

 - A negative arg (e.g. `M--', to mark) or a zero arg (e.g. `M-0', to
   unmark) means use the absolute file name, that is, including all
   directory components.

 - A positive arg (e.g. `M-+', to mark) or a double plain arg (`C-u
   C-u', to unmark) means construct the name relative to
   `default-directory'.  For an entry in an inserted subdir listing,
   this means prefix the relative file name (no directory part) with
   the subdir name relative to `default-directory'.

Note that the default matching behavior of this command is different
for Dired+ than it is for vanilla Emacs.  Using a positive prefix arg
or a double plain prefix arg (`C-u C-u') gives you the same behavior
as vanilla Emacs (marking or unmarking, respectively): matching
against names that are relative to the `default-directory'.

What Dired+ offers in addition is the possibility to match against
names that are relative (have no directory part - no prefix arg or
`C-u' to mark and unmark, respectively) or absolute (`M--' or `M-0',
respectively).  The default behavior uses relative names because this
is likely to be the more common use case.  But matching against
absolute names gives you more flexibility.

REGEXP is an Emacs regexp, not a shell wildcard.  Thus, use `\\.o$'
for object files--just `.o' might mark more than you might expect.

REGEXP is added to `regexp-search-ring', for regexp search.

Non-interactively:
 MARKER-CHAR is the marker character - used for `dired-marker-char'.
 LOCALP is passed to `dired-get-filename'.  It determines the form of
   filename that is matched against REGEXP.

Mark files for which PREDICATE returns non-nil.

PREDICATE is a lisp sexp that can refer to the following symbols as
variables:

    `mode'   [string]  file permission bits, e.g. \"-rw-r--r--\"
    `nlink'  [integer] number of links to file
    `size'   [integer] file size in bytes
    `uid'    [string]  owner
    `gid'    [string]  group (If the gid is not displayed by `ls',
                       this will still be set (to the same as uid))
    `time'   [string]  the time that `ls' displays, e.g. \"Feb 12 14:17\"
    `name'   [string]  the name of the file
    `sym'    [string]  if file is a symbolic link, the linked-to name,
                       else \"\"
    `inode'  [integer] the inode of the file (only for `ls -i' output)
    `blks'   [integer] the size of the file for `ls -s' output
                       (ususally in blocks or, with `-k', in Kbytes)
Examples:
  Mark zero-length files: `(equal 0 size)'
  Mark files last modified on Feb 2: `(string-match \"Feb  2\" time)'
  Mark uncompiled Emacs Lisp files (`.el' file without a `.elc' file):
     First, Dired just the source files: `dired *.el'.
     Then, use \\[dired-mark-sexp] with this sexp:
          (not (file-exists-p (concat name \"c\")))

There's an ambiguity when a single integer not followed by a unit
prefix precedes the file mode: It is then parsed as inode number
and not as block size (this always works for GNU coreutils ls).

Another limitation is that the uid field is needed for the
function to work correctly.  In particular, the field is not
present for some values of `ls-lisp-emulation'.

This function operates only on the Dired buffer content.  It does not
refer at all to the underlying file system.  Contrast this with
`find-dired', which might be preferable for the task at hand.

Install PACKAGE and run initialization FORM.

PACKAGE can be either a simple package name or a package name
with a modifier before the name to specify local recipe source
information:

* `<owner>/' : specifies a Github owner name
* `gist:<id>' : specifies a Gist ID
* `<type>:' : specifies a type of the package source

If `FEATURE in PACKAGE' form is used instead of PACKAGE, then
that FEATURE is `require'd after installing PACKAGE.  You can
also use `el-get-bundle!' macro if FEATURE and PACKAGE are the
same.  If you wish to `require' more than one feature, then use
`:features' property in FORM.

The initialization FORM may start with a property list that
describes a local recipe.  The property list may include the keyword
`:bundle-sync' with a value of either `t' or `nil' to request that
`el-get-bundle' invoke `el-get' synchronously (respectively asynchronously).
The keyword `:bundle-async' is the inverse of `:bundle-sync'.
\(Note that the request to run el-get synchronously may not be respected in all
circumstances: see the definition of `el-get-bundle-el-get' for details.)
The FORM after the property list is treated as initialization code,
which is actually an `:after' property of the local recipe.

A copy of the initialization code is stored in a directory
specified by `el-get-bundle-init-directory' and its byte-compiled
version is used if `el-get-bundle-byte-compile' is non-nil.
